# TO-DO List

Add in the actual content into the paragraph with links to our google docs

Here are some recommended content from Canvas.  (Covered topics will be strikethroughed.)
1. ~~The problem you were trying to solve~~ 
2. ~~A description of the methods you employed~~ 
3. ~~The results of your work, including:~~
   1. Competitive analysis
   2. ~~Understanding of your users and your personas~~
   3. The final design
   4. Evaluation results
4. ~~Reflections on the process and the outcomes~~
5. ~~Acknowledgements (including any outside help not mentioned elsewhere)~~

Add in images of our wireframe and mockup to both the HTML and the Github
Check both HTML and CSS with https://validator.w3.org/ (Use the text input, not the file input)

Check for accessibility with https://achecker.achecks.ca/checker/index.php (Aim to resolve all of the errors, but think through whether the warnings (or potential problems) are actually problems. Include separate checker files for each screen in your webpage.)

If we are using the sidebar, label sections as you go and add it into the sidebar.

Responsive content (so far the sidebar is responsive, unsure about images or text)
