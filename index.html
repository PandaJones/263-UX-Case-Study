 <p class = "draft2">
  Procrastination is a common problems that can have negative effects once out of hand.
  The constant struggle to meet deadlines, and lack of time to finish tasks can cause be overwhelming at times.<br>
  We wanted to design an application that could help the public alleviate this problem, and develop time management skills,
  in an entertaining way.<br>

  <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GDowF-chDqKk2ICY4ZZYqJTrEml7K4tfYNxsVJlYFNA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Proposal</a>
 </p>

 <!-- categorize this whole section as research phase-->
 <h3 class = "second" id = "method">User Research</h3>
 <p class = "para_content">
  In our research phase, we initially began by interviewing multiple potential users for their opinions
  on procrastination, and their own methods with dealing with it. For consistency we developed a script that would
  be read to each interviewee, which consisted of both warm-up questions and questions that focused on extracting
  specific information on the subject of procrastination and its effects.<br>
  <br>
  The link below provides a copy of the questions asked to our subjects.<br>

 </p>

 <h3 class = "second" id = "competitive">Competitive Analysis</h3>
 <p class = "para_content">
  As part of above mentioned phase, we also looked to the market for what was currently available for our target users.
  We filled out a form that summarized our competitors, and explained our idea. This gave a sense of the activities and
  resources necessary to achieve our goals, and justify the business case for pursuing the development project.<br>
  <br>
  The link below provides a copy of our analysis of the market.<br>

 <h3 class = "second" id = "users">Users and Personas</h3>
 <h5 class="third">Personas</h5>
 <p class = "para_content">
  In our next phase we conglomerated our interview notes together on Miro, an online whiteboard,
  and separated our finding into individual ideas and perspectives. With these grouping, were were able to create 3 user
  archetypes, which served to guide our construction of our preliminary wireframes for our application. <br>
  <!--  might want to mention here what are the archetypes wih images and/or bullets-->

  <br>
  The link below provides a copy of our research and archetypes.<br>
  <a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FlhgsrmzJY9hKSob2IcWXOBQeLtjjMUfVyqFfGQZlg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">User Research and Personas</a>
  <br></p>

  <h5 class="third">User Stories and Epics</h5>
  <p class = "para_content">
   From our personas we created user stories and epics. With these, we were able to hone in on what features our users wanted and needed.
   For each epic, we created a scenario in which a feature or action was being used by a user. This exercise brought to light
   the possible intentions of the user, and the logistics of such actions and features.<br>
   After we completed this, we began designing a wireframe for our system, using the Figma workspace.
   Every feature that was created is the direct result of the epics and stories that we created from our user research. <br>

   <br>
   The link below provides a copy of our stories and epics.<br>

  </p>

 <h3 class = "second" id ="prototype">Prototyping</h3>
 <p class = "para_content">
   In the wireframe we constructed, we initially had our user's character profile a the initial screen they saw when
  fist logging in. We also decided that the best way to navigate through our application would be through a navigation bar.
  Through this, the user would be able to check on their calendar and agenda. In our wireframe we thought it would
  be beneficial to include the task creation page, to gauge whether the pacing and process was intuitive.

 </p>

 <h3 class = "second" id = "eval">Evaluation Results</h3>
 <p class = "para_content">
  Upon a second round of interviews, we created a revised wireframe. Many of the comments and suggestions we were able
  to gather from our subjects focused on the lack of navigation buttons on some screens, and the lack of detail and/or
  clarification with viewing and adding tasks to the agenda. We therefore, strove to add clearer buttons and included
  fake inputs inputs into some of the fields to better give users an idea of what would be expected from them when using our features. <br>

 <p class = "para_content">
  Overall, this was a great but also very exhausting process for design a product to solve a certain problem. I can see now how difficult it really is to
  design products using UX in the a system development lifecycle. (Add more here).

 <h3 class = "second" id = "acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h3>
 <p class = "para_content">
  Thanks for all the interviewees participated in our project. They are our friends, some of them are out of the US, and they helped us finish all the interviews. <br>
  Thanks for the professor and both TAs. With you, we got more insights into UX and UI. <br>
  Thanks for everyone helps us during this process. <br> <br>
