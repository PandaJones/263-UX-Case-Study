 <p class = "draft2">
  Procrastination is a common problems that can have negative effects once out of hand.
  The constant struggle to meet deadlines, and lack of time to finish tasks can cause be overwhelming at times.<br>
  We wanted to design an application that could help the public alleviate this problem, and develop time management skills,
  in an entertaining way.<br>

 <h3 class = "third" id = "method">User Research</h3>
 <p class = "draft3">
  In our research phase, we initially began by interviewing multiple potential users for their opinions
  on procrastination, and their own methods with dealing with it. For consistency we developed a script that would
  be read to each interviewee, which consisted of both warm-up questions and questions that focused on extracting
  specific information on the subject of procrastination and its effects.<br>
  <br>
  The link below provides a copy of the questions asked to our subjects.<br>

 <p class = "draft43">
  Based on the user research and the personas we created, we turn that into epics. With these epics, we can really hone in on what features our users wants. 
  From each epic, we can create user stories detailing the actions that a user would do with this feature. After we completed that, we begin a figma workspace in order to create
  a wireframe for our system. Every feature that was created is the direct result of the epics and stories that we created from our user research.

 <p class = "draft5">
  Overall, this was a great but also very exhausting process for design a product to solve a certian problem. I can see now how difficult it really is to
  design products using UX in the a system development lifecycle. (Add more here).

 <h3 class = "sixth" id = "acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h3>
 <p class = "draft6">
  Thanks for all the interviewees participated in our project. They are our friends, some of them are out of the US, and they helped us finish all the interviews. <br>
  Thanks for the professor and both TAs. With you, we got more insights into UX and UI. <br>
  Thanks for everyone helps us during this process. <br>
