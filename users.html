  In our next phase we conglomerated our interview notes together on Miro, an online whiteboard,
  and separated our finding into individual ideas and perspectives. With these grouping, were were able to create 3 user
  archetypes, which served to guide our construction of our preliminary wireframes for our application. <br>
  <!--  might want to mention here what are the archetypes wih images and/or bullets-->

  <br></p>

  <h5 class="third">User Stories and Epics</h5>
  <p class = "para_content">
   From our personas we created user stories and epics. With these, we were able to hone in on what features our users wanted and needed.
   For each epic, we created a scenario in which a feature or action was being used by a user. This exercise brought to light
   the possible intentions of the user, and the logistics of such actions and features.<br>
   After we completed this, we began designing a wireframe for our system, using the Figma workspace.
   Every feature that was created is the direct result of the epics and stories that we created from our user research. <br>
