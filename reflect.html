  Overall, this was a great but also very exhausting process for design a product to solve a certain problem. We can see now how difficult it really is to
  design products using UX in the a system development lifecycle. <br>
  During this process, we learned to survey user experiences and create a brand new user interface. Even though it is exhausting,
  we learned to use different tools that can help us build a mock-up of a user interface.<br>
  Most important of all, we learned to know more about our users. This is a very different experience from most of the
  classes. As the professor said in the last lecture: we aren't just designing technology, we are designing people's lives!
  By learning from our users, we can design our work around the people, and make people's lives better!
